      <li><strong>1939</strong> - Edhi starts to take care of his recently paralysed mother and devoted himself for looking after all her needs; cleaning, bathing, changing clothes and feeding.</li>

      <li><strong>1947</strong> - His mother passed away, leaving him to think about millions like his mother whom have no one to take care of them. This is where he decided to dedicate his life towards helping others.</li>

      <li><strong>1949</strong> - He left his occupation of a commission agent and established free dispensary along with few other people.</li>

      <li><strong>1951</strong> - His personal vision of a growing and developing system of multifarious services made him decide to establish a welfare trust of his own and named it as “Edhi Trust”.</li>

      <li><strong>1957</strong> - Edhi established first welfare center.</li>

      <li><strong>1965</strong> - Abdul Sattar Edhi was married to Bilquis, a nurse who worked at the Edhi dispensary. The couple have four children, two daughters and two sons.</li>

      <li><strong>2013</strong> - Edhi's kidneys failed, with doctors announcing that he would be on dialysis for the rest of his life unless he found an appropriate kidney donor.</li>

      <li><strong>2016</strong> - Edhi died at the age of 88 due to kidney failure after having been placed on a ventilator. His last wishes included a request that his organs be donated to those in need.</li>
    </ul>

      Over his lifetime, the Edhi Foundation expanded, backed entirely by private donations, which included establishing a network of 1,800 ambulances. By the time of his death, Edhi was registered as a parent or guardian of nearly 20,000 adopted children. He is known amongst Pakistanis as the <i>"Angel of Mercy"</i> and is considered to be Pakistan's most respected and legendary figure.
